        //instead of making 100 variables we can make a list of values for one variables using Array data type
        //composite data type which can stor number of values in one variable
        // index      0      1      2
        var cars = ["Audi","BMW","Skoda"];
        cars.push("Mercedes");
        var ary1;
        ary1 = new Array("Mango","Apple","Banana"); // you can create an array like this way too
         
        /*document.write("<h3>"+cars+"</h3>");
        // if you want to access a specific value you can by putting index number
        documen.write("<h3>"+cars[1]+"</h3>"); // prints BMW
         */
        //indexes come handy when using loops 
        //for(var i=0;i<4;i++) //i will be initiated from 0 index, i is less than 3 because we have only 3 values
        for(var i=0;i<cars.length;i++)
        {
            document.write("<h3> "+cars[i]+" </h3>"); // this will print all the values
           // document.write("<h3> "+ary1[i]+" </h3>"); // access ary1 array
            //document.write("<h3> "+cars[2]+" </h3>"); // this will print Skoda 3 times
        }

        //Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic : you can make an array of different types
        //example: ["Audi","BMW",2];
        //also you can increment and decrement array list at runtime
        //example: cars.push("mercedes"); Arrays are objects with properties and methods
        //and push is one of the methods of object Arrays in Javascript.
        //now adding length value all the time in for loop i<3 / i<4 is not smart 
        //so we use a property known as .length -> now in loop for(var i=0;i<cars.length;i++)
        //now even if you increase / decrease lenght of an array because of the property the code will always run

        let example = [5,6,7,8,9];
        example.forEach((element)=> {
            console.log(element)
        }); // this will print out each element in a array 1 by 1. Usually forEach needs a call back function here it is the arrow function.

       //let example2 = example; // you created a new variable with reference of example so even though push was called on example2 it made changes to example too.
       //to avoid this you can use spread operator i.e let example2 = [...example]; it won't pass by reference.
        example2.push(11);

        console.log(example);
        console.log(example2);
