       //OPERATOR ASSOCIATIVITY

        var a = 4; // = assignment operator has right to left associativity RHS is assigned to LHS
        var b = 3;
        var c = 6;
        var result = a+b; 
        var result2 = a+b+c; //addition operator has left to right associativity i.e first a+b will happen then result of a+b will be added to c
        var result3 = "ila"+b+c; // as we know that + has left to right assoc. b and c will also be shown as string because ila is string
        var result4 = c+a+"ila"+b+c; // this will first add c and a then print ila and value of b and c as string

        document.write("<h1> result : "+result+" </h1>"); //adding two values, putting c in qoutes and + operator is must to concatinate the value
        document.write("<h1> result : "+result2+" </h1>"); 
        document.write("<h2> result : "+result3+" </h2>"); // result is ila36
        document.write("<h3> result : "+result4+" </h4>"); // result is 10ila36

        //therefore it is important to know associativity as it can change the reslt immensely

       //OPERATOR PRECEDENCE BODMAS

        var result5 = a+b*c;
        var result6 = (a+b)*c; // in BODMAS bracket has higher precedence than *
        document.write("<h1> result : "+result5+" </h1>"); // result is 22 as b*c happened first then result of b*c got added to a
        document.write("<h2> result : "+result6+"<h2>"); // result is 42
