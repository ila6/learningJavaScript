           // alert("Button is clicked");
            /*what if you want to change the text of Heading 2 defined in html when button is clicked
            we know that in Javascript has DOM and it sees html tags as objects so every object has some methods and properties therefore,
            document is an object and represents this whole html document and
            getElementId needs ID of the tag, innerHTML is the property of the tag as tags are objects in DOM. Now, innerHTML needs a text
            which is Heading 2 and now because we have set another value it has changed the property value
            
            innerHTML is property that stores the text value in the given ID 
            so for example if we store the value of the property by accessing the tag with getelementID function in the document this is how
            we can do it:

            var x = document.getElementById("hdng").innerHTML;
            alert(x);    Now x will show the text of h2 tag in the pop up after button is clicked because only after event the function btnClick()
            will work.
             */

            document.getElementById("hdng").innerHTML="Text Changed!"; 
        }

    <body>
        <!--so the button html tag has some in built events which we can evoke example is below-->
        <button onclick="btnClick()"> Click me to get popup </button> <!--now this event needs a function to be passed which is made using JavaScript-->
         <h2 id="hdng"> Heading 2 </h2>
