        String type , Numbers type , Bolean type can be an object but with new keyword
        Maths, Dates and regular expressions are objects already

        //Making a string object
        var str = new String(); // we have created an object of String type
        document.write("<h3> The data type is: "+typeof(str)+"</h3>"); // this will tell you the type of the argument passed and the type is object

        //we can add more properties for an object outside the object block. For example, if you want to add a property after 100 lines of code
        var Car = {

        brand_name :"Tesla",

        Car.fuel_type = "Electric"; // this is added to the properties of Car object.

        document.write("<h3> "+Car.fuel_type+"</h3>");

        }

        //deleting properties
        delete Car.price;

        document.write("<h3> "+Car.price+" </h3>"); // this will show result as undefined

        //we can change the type of a property dynamically too
        Car.car_model = 3;
        document.write("<h3> "+typeof(Car.car_model)+" </h3>"); // it shows number as the type.

        
        
        
        // so when we create object , it contains properties or keys and values e.g firstName is a key and value is ila
        let example = {
            firstName : 'Ila',
            lastName : 'Sharma',
            age : 26,
            address : {
                city : 'Tampere',
                postcode : 33710
            }


        }

       // if we want to print all the key we can do that by writing:
       console.log(Object.keys(example)); 
       //if we want only values them:
       console.log(Object.values(example));
       //we can also check a particular PROPERTY in an object:
       console.log(example.hasOwnProperty('firstName')); // this prints true.



       //we can also instantiate an object in cases like these. However, it is best to always create seperate objects and not reference them to other objects.
       // this is why a new object is to be created than referenced:
       /*let example2 = example;
       
       example2.catName = 'meow';

       console.log(example); 
       console.log(example2);*/ // this will have exact same properties as example and whenever changes are made to this object example object will also change so best is to create a new object
       let example2 = Object.assign({}, example); // this will equal the properties but they both will seperate objects as assign method makes an empty object for example i.e seperate object
       example2.catName = 'meow';
       console.log(example); 
       console.log(example2); // now we have catName only to example2 object not example.
